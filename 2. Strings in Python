String can be written in 3 ways in python 

1) single quote --- 'Hello'
2) double quote --- "Hello"
3) triple quote --- '''Hello'''

b = "Aman's" ---> Use this when we have a single quote in String
print(b)
print(type(b))


---------------------
String Concatination

name = "Aman"   -----> Length => 4

Indexing starts from 0 to (length -1) in python.  

example:-  
greeting ="Good Morning,"
name = " Aman"

c= greeting + name
print(c)

#name[3] = 'd' ----> We cannot change the character of string it will NOT WORK

------------------------
#SLICING IN PYTHON 
print(name[0:3])  #---> It will exclude the last number it will only print till 0,1,2


#SLICING with Skip Value ---> We can provide a skip value as a part of our slice the character we want to skip

name = "Amazing"

d = name[1:6:1]  #---> It will not skip anything  #OUTPUT -- mazin

d= name[1:6:2]  #---> It will skip 1-1 value in betwwen #OUTPUT -- mzn
print(d)


------------------------
Indexing in python ----> Indexing starts from 0 and to (length-1)

name = "Harry"
print(name[:3]) #----> It is same as name[0:3] 
print(name[1:]) # ---> It is same as name[1:5]

#Negative Indexing ----> Negative index starts from last character of the string and mive on to left side like -5,-4,-3,-2,-1

print(name[-4:-1]) #-----> This is same as name[1:4]

				STRING FUNCTIONS in PYTHON 
--------------------------------------------


story ="once upon a time there was a developer who used to love to build amazing website and work with amazing new tools in the development"

#String Fucntions 

print(len(story))   #------>It will return the length of the String 

print(story.endswith("vdhgvhd"))  # ------>This function tells whether the string ends with "vdhgvhd" this or not and it will return TRUE or FALSE

print(story.count("d"))   #-----> It will count the total number of occurance in the string 

print(story.capitalize())  #----> It will capitalize the first character of the string  

print(story.find("developer"))  #----->This fucntion finds the word and returns the index of (first) occurance of that word in the String

print(story.replace("to","HELLOTHIS")) #---> It will replace all the occurances with the new word in the string


---------------------------
Escape Squence in PYTHON (\n , \t , \ , \\ )

story ="Amna is a good.\nHe is very good boy" 
print(story)  

OUTPUT:-  Amna is a good.
		  He is very good boy
