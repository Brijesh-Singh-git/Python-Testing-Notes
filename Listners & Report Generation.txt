What are Listeners?
Listeners are functions that wait for an event/results to occur and capture the action of an event.

The listeners can capture both webdriver actions and unit test results.

Listeners for webdriver actions are handled by Event Listeners.
Listeners for test results are handled by Unit TestResult Listeners.


------------------------
Event listeners:
Event listeners are functions in selenium python bindings that wait for an event to occur; 
that event may be a user clicking or finding, changing the value, or an Exception. The listeners are programmed to react to an input or signal.

There is a function to react when an even is about to happen; also, there is a function to react after the event.

AbstractEventListener provides pre and the post event listeners, so to use these listeners, 
we have to implement those listeners by inheriting AbstractEventListener.


-------------------------
EventFiringWebDriver:
EventFiringWebDriver is a wrapper on the webdriver which provides all the methods that the webdriver provides. 
EventFiringWebDriver provides two more functions to register and unregister the listeners implementing the class.

Reports 
Reporting plays an important role in test automation. It is equally important to incorporate report generation as a part of test automation. 
More on reporting and report generation can be understood from the upcoming video resource.
